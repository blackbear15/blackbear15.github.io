<h1>Info About Me</h1>

<p>Like I said on the homepage, I was born in Long Island and moved to Maine in the 4th grade. I attended Cape Elizabeth High school and graduated in the year 2018. Now I attend the University of Maine, Orono. In high school I was student class president and played on a lot of sports teams. My favorite sport was football, where I was a team captain. </p>
